### Hi there 👋
My name is Marine, pleased to meet you

- 👸🏽 She/her
- 🏫 Information systems student
- 🗺️ Brazilian

For now, I code mostly for fun and don't usually share the things i do, so this account is mostly abandoned

I speak english and portuguese so feel free to use either
(I am studying japanese but am not good enough to sustain conversations ごめん)

The best way to contact me is through discord
